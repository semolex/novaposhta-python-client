# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for the development of our Python API client library, 
we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience 
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, 
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We condemn any affiliation with state agressors or terrorists supporting genocidal policies from such individuals and countires.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Writing clear, documented, and maintainable code
* Providing constructive and respectful feedback on pull requests
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the library's users
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Being patient with new contributors and users

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Spamming, flooding, or any form of automated engagement
* Deliberate attempt to break or compromise the library or its users

## Technical Standards

As this is a Python API client library, we also expect:

* Code submissions follow PEP 8 style guidelines
* All new features include appropriate tests
* Documentation is kept up-to-date with changes
* Security best practices are followed
* API credentials and sensitive data are never committed to the repository
* Performance implications are considered for all changes

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

* Clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior
* Taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior
* Reviewing code contributions in a timely manner
* Maintaining the quality and security of the codebase
* Protecting user data and API credentials
* Ensuring the library remains reliable and maintainable

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [semolex@live.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Resolution Process

1. First violation: Warning with an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate
2. Second violation: Temporary ban from project contribution (1 month)
3. Third violation: Permanent ban or permanent loss of contribution privileges

## Technical Dispute Resolution

For technical disputes:
1. Open an issue with detailed explanation
2. Discussion period of 7 days
3. Maintainer decision based on:
   * Alignment with project goals
   * Technical merit
   * User impact
   * Maintenance burden
