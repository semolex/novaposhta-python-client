## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/semolex/novaposhta-python-client/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/semolex/novaposhta-python-client/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Always use [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)
* Annotate types whether it is possible.
* Docstring are in [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) format.
